        <h2>HTML</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
      <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
      <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a body element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
      <li>For semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage</li>
      <li>HTML attributes define additional information about an element. For example inside the html tag is an attribute of lang=en. This tells the browser the language for the page is English.</li>
      <li>Semantic HTML elements can be used to indicate the role of their content, as well as to give structure to the content of the webpage.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>An external CSS style sheet giis preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. </li>
        <li>The term seperation of concerns refers to seperating the code into different files based on use. It is based on the idea that each code should have its own responsibility.</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

      <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
      <li>Since control flow dictates that JavaScript files are executed from top to bottom, order matters.</li>
